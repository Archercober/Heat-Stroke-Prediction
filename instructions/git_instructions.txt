These are some instruction on how to use git so that we can all edit our code and have it backed up in one repository (on GitHub)

Our repository is located here:
https://github.com/jondeaton/Heat_Stroke_Prediction

1) Downloading the latest code in our repository
	- open a terminal (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app)
	- Change directory into a location where you want to download
		(like this: cd <file path>)
	- type:
		git clone <URL>.git
		(but replace URL with the URL of our repository)

2) The previous command should have made a folder/dicrectory called "Heat_Stroke_Prediction" containing all of our code files. Now you can edit any of the files/code

3) To "save" your changes to the repository (called commiting)
	- while in the project folder/directory (should be named Heat_Stroke_Prediction)
	  type:
		git pull 
		(This will update your project with any changes that others have made while you were making your own changes)
	- type:
		git add <some file that you edited>
		(This is how you select which files to commit changes to)
	- type:
		git commit -m "Put a message here that indicates what you changed"
		(This "commits" your changes)
	- type: 
		git push
		(This sends your changes to our github repository)
