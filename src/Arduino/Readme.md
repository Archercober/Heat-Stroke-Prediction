# Milestone 3 â€“ Arduino Code

We used this code in Milestone 3 of BIOE 141B to test the accuracy of our Heat Stroke Monitor sensors.

## Results from sensor system, Heller Lab test 2/17/17

Due to code that was not fully integrated, measurements for each sensor were viewed on Arduino Serial Monitor manually recorded for 2 minutes over ~6.5 minute intervals. Heart rate trends appear to be consistent with gold standard data (see Figure 3, Figure D.2). Temperature and humidity were measured inside of the garbage bags covering the hands, which become very hot and moist due to collected perspiration over time and may have skewed sensor readings.


## Gathering sensor data and comparing with gold standard.
